Description: Testing differential abundance at individual taxa and in a whole microbial community. While the 'locom' function was developed to analyze one sequencing dataset, the newer 'Com2seq' function combines two sequencing datasets (e.g., from 16S marker-gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing) for integrative analysis of differential abundance. All tests are based on the log-ratio of relative abundances between each taxon and a reference taxon (no need to specify). All tests accommodate continuous, discrete (binary, categorical), and multivariate traits, and allows adjustment of confounders.
